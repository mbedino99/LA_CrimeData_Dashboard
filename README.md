Project #3: Project Proposal
Team Members: Martin Bedino, David Pinsky, Lois Stetson, Nathan-Andrew Tompkins

City of Los Angeles Crime:

Our plan is to analyze the City of LA crime data to determine different variables and how they relate to crime rates based on age, types of weapons, locations of division police stations, etc... 
For Example these are a few questions we plan to analyze and provide interactive visualization: 
Determine crime based on location of police stations based on divisions in the city of Los angeles: Map chart interactive visualization

Weapons - most used weapon

How does time of year and time of day effect the amount of crime? 

Dashboard layout mockup is attached in repo.
