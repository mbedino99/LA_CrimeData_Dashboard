City of Los Angeles Crime:

Our plan is to analyze the City of LA crime data to determine different variables and how they relate to crime rates based on age, types of weapons, locations of division police stations, etc... 
For Example these are a few questions we plan to analyze and provide interactive visualization: 
Determine crime based on location of police stations based on divisions in the city of Los angeles: Map chart interactive visualization
Weapons - most used weapon
Victim age
How does time of year and time of day affects the amount of crime?
